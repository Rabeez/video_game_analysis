Data Analysis for Video Games
===============================

This repo chronicles my exploration into a few datasets related to video games I randomly found. 

Overall the dataset contains sales, playtime and rating information primarily for PC titles but I've put more details of the dataset (along with links) in this [notebook](1%20-%20Cleaning.ipynb). 

There is no concrete goal or outcome I am gunning for with this project. This is just supposed to be a single focused application of the techniques I've learned while studying Data Science and Machine Learning. 

Here are a few things I (currently) want to look into
- Identify clusters of gamers based on their playtimes
- Find anomalies in user playtimes
- Quantify importance of critic score as a determining factor for overall sales and user perception
- Create a *quality* indicator based on ratings, sales, playtimes etc.
- Compare '*quality*-adjusted' price with listed price (overpriced / underpriced)
- Check effect of switching out regional sales for global sales
- Compare 'time-adjusted' sales with cummulative sales
